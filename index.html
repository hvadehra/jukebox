<div>									[Verse 1]<br />These ideas are nightmares to white parents<br />Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings<br />Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows<br />no swearing<br />To see him walking around with his headphones blaring<br />Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care<br />He's a problem child<br />And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about<br />His fuckin' dad walkin' out<br />Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out<br />If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out<br />His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back<br />Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap<br />He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap<br />His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose<br />His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions<br />go...<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />{C'mon}, sing with me, {sing}, sing for the years<br />{Sing it}, sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, {c'mon)<br />Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you<br />away...<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's<br />In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum<br />Holy or unholy, only have one homie<br />Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me<br />Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a<br />mothafucka they can be great<br />Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate<br />It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make<br />Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum<br />Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen<br />From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'<br />To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass<br />But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you<br />Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you<br />To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind<br />every time you mad<br />So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon<br />Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns<br />That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off<br />of these streets quickly<br />But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while<br />police fingerprint me<br />They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me<br />If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete<br />It's all political, if my music is literal, and i'm a criminal how the fuck<br />can I raise a little girl<br />I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that<br />was a fist that hit you...<br /><br />[CHORUS]<br /><br />[Verse 3]<br />They say music can alter moods and talk to you<br />Well can it load a gun up for you , and cock it too<br />Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude<br />Just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued<br />See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols<br />And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool<br />Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers<br />Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus<br />But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our<br />checks in the mail<br />It's fucked up ain't it<br />How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin'<br />thing that we wanted<br />That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing<br />Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine<br />Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long<br />Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs<br />Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives<br />Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die<br />Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe<br />We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes<br />That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and<br />hold it<br />Cause we consider these minutes golden<br />And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone<br />Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our<br />songs and we can...<br /><br />[CHORUS X2]							</div>
