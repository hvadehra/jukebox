<h1>James Blunt</h1>
<h2>So Long, Jimmy</h2>
<h3>Back to Bedlam</h3>

<hr/>

<div><!-- start of lyrics -->I just can't believe that it's over.<br />We were chilling out on the sofa,<br />Digging how the guitar goes,<br />In a song that no one knows.<br />Did you lick that line yourself,<br />Or did the voodoo magic help?<br />Does everyone have a different take?<br />Do you seem real but I seem fake?<br />Does everyone get hypnotized by your fire?<br /><br />So long, Jimmy, so long.<br />Though you only stayed a moment,<br />We all know that you're the one. Singing,<br />So long, Jimmy, so long.<br />Sure we're glad for the experience,<br />We miss you now you've gone.<br />We're just swimming in your soul 'cause,<br />We all wish we wrote this song.<br />Life goes on.<br /><br />I'm just so relieved that it's over.<br />We were hanging out going nowhere,<br />Digging how the guitar goes,<br />In a song that no one knows.<br />Did you burn that bridge yourself,<br />Or did the voodoo magic help?<br />Does everyone have a different take?<br />Are you just cool and I'm just baked?<br />Does everyone get mesmerized by your fire?<br /><br />So long, Jimmy, so long.<br />Though you only stayed a moment,<br />We all know that you're the one. Singing,<br />So long, Jimmy, so long.<br />Sure we're glad for the experience,<br />We miss you now you've gone.<br />We're just swimming in your soul 'cause,<br />We all wish we wrote this song.<br />Life goes on.</div>
